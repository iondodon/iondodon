Here's an overview of some of the repositories:

## 1. [pb (C++, Pascal)](https://github.com/iondodon/pb/tree/master/problems) - Data structures and algorithms

An extensive set of over 400 solved competitive problems utilized in national and international Informatics Olympiads.

## 2. [multiplexer (Golang)](https://github.com/iondodon/multiplexer) - Multiplexer

This multiplexer server receives messages via SSH from a remote sender and forwards them to client subscribers. The multiplexer takes each message from the remote sender and places them in a queue. Each subscribed client has a dedicated goroutine (called a client goroutine) that iterates through the queue and sends each message to the client.

## 3. [httpok (Tauri)](https://github.com/iondodon/httpok) - httpok is a fast, minimalistic desktop HTTP client

**httpok** is a fast, minimalistic desktop HTTP client built with Tauri and SvelteKit. It lets you compose and test HTTP requests in a code editor interface, offering a lightweight alternative to tools like Postman or Insomnia.

## 4. [manter (Rust)](https://github.com/iondodon/manter) - A Modern Terminal Experience

Manter is a modern terminal that enhances your command-line experience with features like autocomplete suggestions, syntax highlighting, and more.

## 5. [i3-switcher-x11 (Rust)](https://github.com/iondodon/i3-switcher-x11) - i3wm Alt+Tab Workspace Switcher

The i3wm Alt+Tab Workspace Switcher is a tool designed to bring the familiar Alt+Tab window switching functionality to the i3 window manager environment. It aims to enhance productivity by enabling users to switch between workspaces efficiently and intuitively, mimicking the window switching feature found in traditional desktop environments like Windows.

## 6. [go-vbs (Golang)](https://github.com/iondodon/go-vbs) - Sample vehicle booking system

This is [VBS](https://github.com/iondodon/vbs) (originally implemented in Java) project reimplemented in Go. The project is a sample system for a vehicle hire company. The system keeps a record of the vehicles the company owns and which ones are currently hired out to customers.

## 7. [resilient-scalable-cache (Elixir)](https://github.com/iondodon/resilient-scalable-cache) - Robust, Scalable Cache in Elixir

This repository contains a resilient and scalable cache implementation using Elixir. It is designed based on a master-slave pattern and supports distributed hashing as well as slave replication.

## 8. [fault-tolerant-gateway (Elixir)](https://github.com/iondodon/fault-tolerant-gateway) - An Intelligent Gateway Solution

Fault-tolerant-gateway is a robust and adaptive solution that functions as both a circuit breaker and a load balancer. It also supports service discovery and integrates with the [resilient-scalable-cache](https://github.com/iondodon/resilient-scalable-cache) as its key-value storage system.

## 9. [message-broker (Elixir)](https://github.com/iondodon/message-broker) - Fault-Tolerant Elixir Message Broker

Fault-Tolerant Elixir Message Broker: Efficient Event Distribution and Real-Time Weather Data Aggregation. The fault-tolerant message broker system manages registration and consumption of events across topics. It enables distribution of events through multiple HTTP routes and allows publishers to send messages to specific topics. Subscribers can register and listen to events on desired topics, while the system efficiently aggregates and processes data from various topics.

## 10. [Timeline Explorer](https://github.com/iondodon/timeline) - Timeline Explorer

An interactive visualization tool that brings history to life through an interconnected timeline and map interface. This project allows users to explore historical events across time and space, providing rich context and detailed information for each event.

## 11. [MyOS (Assembler)](https://github.com/iondodon/MyOS) - A Basic Custom Operating System written in Assembly

Low-level Operating System kernel written is Assembly (NASM). It provides a command prompt where users can enter a variety of supported commands. Examples of some commands are: `writeflp` - Writes text data to the floppy disk (the same disk from which the OS is loaded), `readflp` - reads text data from the floppy disk, `draw` - displays an animated UTM text.
