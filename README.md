Here's an overview of some of the repositories:

## 1. [pb](https://github.com/iondodon/pb/tree/master/problems) - Data structures and algorithms

An extensive set of over 400 solved competitive problems utilized in national and international Informatics Olympiads.

## 2. [manter (Rust)](https://github.com/iondodon/manter) - A Modern Terminal Experience

Manter is a modern terminal that enhances your command-line experience with features like autocomplete suggestions, syntax highlighting, and more.

## 3. [beehive (Rust)](https://github.com/iondodon/beehive) - Beehive: Distributed Key-Value Store

Beehive is a distributed key-value store currently under development, leveraging the Rust programming language for high performance and safety. It employs a master-slave architecture to ensure data reliability and availability across clustered environments. With distributed hashing for efficient data distribution and automatic failover mechanisms, Beehive aims to provide seamless scalability and fault tolerance for distributed systems.

## 4. [resilient-scalable-cache](https://github.com/iondodon/resilient-scalable-cache) - Robust, Scalable Cache in Elixir

This repository contains a resilient and scalable cache implementation using Elixir. It is designed based on a master-slave pattern and supports distributed hashing as well as slave replication.

## 5. [fault-tolerant-gateway](https://github.com/iondodon/fault-tolerant-gateway) - An Intelligent Gateway Solution

Fault-tolerant-gateway is a robust and adaptive solution that functions as both a circuit breaker and a load balancer. It also supports service discovery and integrates with the [resilient-scalable-cache](https://github.com/iondodon/resilient-scalable-cache) as its key-value storage system.

## 6. [message-broker](https://github.com/iondodon/message-broker) - Fault-Tolerant Elixir Message Broker

Fault-Tolerant Elixir Message Broker: Efficient Event Distribution and Real-Time Weather Data Aggregation. The fault-tolerant message broker system manages registration and consumption of events across topics. It enables distribution of events through multiple HTTP routes and allows publishers to send messages to specific topics. Subscribers can register and listen to events on desired topics, while the system efficiently aggregates and processes data from various topics.

## 7. [MyOS](https://github.com/iondodon/MyOS) - A Basic Custom Operating System written in Assembly

Low-level Operating System kernel written is Assembly (NASM). It provides a command prompt where users can enter a variety of supported commands. Examples of some commands are: `writeflp` - Writes text data to the floppy disk (the same disk from which the OS is loaded), `readflp` -  reads text data from the floppy disk, `draw` - displays an animated UTM text.
